# Vagrant Tutorial

This repository is the [counterpart for a tutorial on my website](https://danielgroves.net/notebook/2014/05/development-environments/ "Vagrant and Ansible Development ENvironments"). It probably won't be actively maintained in the long run.

If you're a PHP user checkout the PHP branch, the master branch targets Python/Django setups.

It would also be wise to read the license within the repository before doing anything with it.

Please not that **nothing in this repository is production ready**, and you'll be open to a *lot* of different attacks should you use this in production. However, it should be fine for most peoples development needs. Your goal should be to mimic your production environment as closely as possible though, so that any issues are found before deploying.
